# Project description
To incentivise users to our product, we chose to focus on how resembler.ai's software and continuously colllected accidents data can help them with insurance claims(using the uploaded data to build a strong case for insurance claims) and preventing unforseen accidents to a certain extent. We created a web application that outlines the troubles that are often found with insurance
claims and accidents caused by lack of information on the path used to travel. The web app has a 'map' route that shows all locations of recorded accidents and areas that are more prone to accidents which helps avoid unnecessary accidents by warning users of roads to be alert of or avoid entirely.All these feauteres provided to our customers encourage them to upload data concerning accidents they've experienced because these feautures show the user how this data can be used for their benefit. The last route(upload route) leads the user to resember.ai's page where they will be able to upload their video.
# Project execution
You can download the files from the repository. 
Make sure to pip install flask on your system
Run the web app by entering "flask run" in your terminal and a local session should open
using data already collected by resembler.ai there are areas already marked or pinned for accidents, in their respective categories(hovering over the pinned markers give you more info about the warning marker).
Users can also add their own marks by first choosing the category of the warning and marking the area(only the most recent marker can be undone to fix a marking mistake)
# Future Roadmap
Please describe the future of your application: 
As more videos are uploaded, the pins on the map will continue to increase hence we are to cover more different areas and inform more customers with more accurate data. 
As we gain more users we hope to one day deploy it as a mobile app for convinience.
# Additional comments
We didn't have a database.
Due to the fact that google discontinued the directions api and we are unfamiliar with their new routes api we couldn't add a directions feature to help users find better paths when driving from point A to point B while being guided through or from the accident prone zones.
