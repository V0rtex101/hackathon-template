# Project description
To incentivies users to our product, we chose to focus on how resembler.ai's software can help them with insurance claims. We created a web application that outlines the troubles that are often found with insurance
claims. The web app also has a map route that shows all locations of recorded accidents and illustrates them to the user to show how their data is actually being used to establish reliability with them. The last route leads the user to resember.ai's page where they will be able to upload their video.
# Project execution
You can download the files from the repository. 
Make sure to pip install flask on your system
Run the web app by entering "flask run" in your terminal and a local session should open

# Future Roadmap
Please describe the future of your application. 
As more videos are uploaded, the pins on the map will continue to increase hence we are to cover more different areas. 


# Additional comments
We didn't have a database
